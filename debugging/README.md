# Sprint 2, Week 1: ChatGPT - Introduction

## FILE: factorial.py
**0. Debugging - Python Factorial**  

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/factorial.py)  
Fix the code, it should print the factorial of the argument.  

## FILE: print_arguments.py
**1. Debugging - Python Arguments**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/print_arguments.py).  
Fix the code, it should print only the arguments without the python file name.

## FILE: change_background.html
**2. Debugging - HTML / Javascript**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/change_background.html). [This](https://onecompiler.com/html/) editor can be use to test your code.  
Fix the code, it should change the background color when you click on the button.

## FILE: mines.py
**3. Debugging - Python Mines**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples.  
**Game Overview:** Minesweeper is a puzzle game where the player must clear a field of hidden “mines” without detonating any of them, using clues about the number of neighboring mines in each field.  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/mines.py).  
Fix the code, implement a mechanism to detect when all non-mine cells have been revealed, thus winning the game.

## FILE: factorial_recursive.py
**4. Documentation - Python Factorial**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to document the code  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/factorial_recursive.py).  
Add the comments to this code. You should have 3 sections: function description, parameters and returns.

## FILE: checkbook.py
**5. Error Handling - Python Checkbook**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to document the code  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/checkbook.py).  
Fix the code, to prevent the program from crashing due to invalid input (e.g., non-numeric values), add error handling mechanisms.

## FILE: tic.py
**6. Debugging - Tic Tac Toe Python**

**Objective:** Use ChatGPT to identify and correct errors in code samples. (There may be several errors on the code)  
**Game Overview:** Players alternate placing “X” or “O” on a 3x3 board, aiming to get three in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally to win.  
You can download the code [here](https://github.com/hs-hq-service/3156/blob/main/tic.py).  
**Warning:** Test all the user inputs !
